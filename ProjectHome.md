Hot Pockets! http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N-i9GXbptog

This is an SDL port of PocketSNES. There are a number of apps called PocketSNES hence naming this "Hot PocketSNES". See [History](History.md).


This SDL port of PocketSNES builds/works on:

  * Native Dingoo - sml port (NOTE expects to be in a:\game\3d\pocketsnes)
  * Open Dingux - SDL video and libao sound
  * Linux x86   - SDL video and libao sound (note also has SDL audio but has sound issues, libao is recommended)

SELECT + START brings up the menu.
